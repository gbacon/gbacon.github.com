<p> My five-year-old daughter is learning to read. I made flash cards for us to practice phonics and recognition, and I wrote this simple app to give her a way to practice on her own too. Thanks to the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/">Wiktionary</a> folks for the pronunciations. 
<p> Along with the buttons, you can advance by pressing Enter or Right-Arrow and hear the word with S or space bar.
<p> The <a href="http://github.com/gbacon/learn-words/">code is available on GitHub</a>.
