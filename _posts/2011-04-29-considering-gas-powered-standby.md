I’ve been wearing my [Bo Williams][bo] Risk Analysis™ cap a fair amount
for the past couple of days, and this post started life as a comment on
his post [Friday miscellanea, post-Alabama tornado super-outbreak
edition][outbreak].

Our house has gas heat and a gas set in the fireplace. I’ve been
letting the latter slide in a state of disrepair. I recognize and accept
this BWRA™ Demerit. It will be ready before winter 2011, which will mean
redundant sources of heat. You ought to see my related [GTD] project
list!

The option is obvious now, but it took a conversation with my dad to
learn about permanent standby generators that run on natural gas and
periodically test themselves. I priced them online and may be able to
purchase a unit that would power most of my house, perhaps in staggered
operation for heavy loads such as HVAC and dryer, for around $5k with no
headaches of managing a gasoline reserve or just–in–time fuel purchases.

The last week–long outage in the area was nearly forty years ago, but
sidestepping even hours–long outages due to storms, ice on power lines,
drunks hitting poles, and so on is awfully appealing too. I emptied the
refrigerator and freezer, and temperatures in the Huntsville area are
projected to be mild. My one power–related worry is my 55–gallon
cichlid tank. I turned on a battery–powered air pump, but that’s about
the best I could do. I think I was a week overdue for a water change
when we lost power, so staying on top of aquarium chores in the future
will help there too, assuming optimistically that these hardy critters
make it.

Other questions:

- Where can I find comprehensive lists of electrical and gas outages
  to find whether I’m trading more–or–less equivalent problems?
- How expensive would backup mode be?
- Fossil fuels in general aren’t getting any cheaper, so at what gas
  price does such a generator become a total dud?
- What about purification of, say, rain water?
- I expect a crazy run on generators when we’re no longer part of the
  third world. What are good value metrics?
- What other issues do I need to consider?
